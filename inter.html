    <h1><b><u>Intermediate:</u></b></h1>
    <img src="images/inter.jpeg">
    <p>Intermediate is the first step toward career-oriented education. Generally, students take primary and secondary education less seriously but when they get to the intermediate level (college), it is time to take things a lot seriously because this is where careers can be constructed on solid ground.Intermediate education is important for the development of students in different fields of study. It offers the opportunity to develop knowledge and skills relevant to the educational level that follows after secondary school. Intermediate education provides a smooth transition from secondary school to university, or from vocational training or a specific middle school course to post-secondary study. Ninis tutor academy is a one-window solution for parents who require intermediate home tutors for their children.An intermediate course may be a certificate or diploma as well. The student may choose to undertake a course to gain skills required for employment or further study, or they may wish to complete an academic program that will eventually lead to a qualification (such as a Bachelor’s degree).
                 <br>In Intermediate it again divides into 3 sub modules or streams they are:
                 <br><b>1.Science stream</b>
                 <br><b>2.Arts stream</b>
                 <br><b>3.Commerce stream</b>
    </p>
    <h1><b><u>1.Science stream:</u></b></h1>
    <p>There are two branches under the Science stream. Non-medical stream (PCM) and medical stream (PCB) with Physics and Chemistry as the common science stream subjects. The third subject can be selected according to one’s aspirations for jobs after 12th science.
        <br>We can majorly name as:
