    <h1><b><u>Entrance exams to B.Tech/Medical</u></b></h1>
    <p>According to state level there is a exam for both courses i.e., Eamcet exam it is conducted through state level only each state has its individual exam for it. </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Eamcet</b></dt>
        <dd>Engineering Agricultural and Medical Common Entrance Test, commonly called as EAMCET, is an entrance examination held separately in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for admission into various colleges across both the states in the streams of Engineering, Medicine and Agriculture.<br>
            The EAMCET is a yearly examination taken by a large number of engineering and medical aspirants in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana State. This is the entrance exam for engineering ('E' category) and medicine ('AM' category: Agriculture and Medicine) for admission to BE/BArch/BTech (Agril Engg/Dairy Tech).<br>
            Candidates should have passed or appeared for the final year of intermediate examination (10+2) with Mathematics,Physics and Chemistry as optional or related vocational courses in the fields of Engineering and Technology held by the Board of Intermediate Education or Diploma Examination in Engineering/Architecture conducted by the State Board of Technical Education & Training or equivalent. Candidates must have Indian nationality.</dd>
        <dt><u>Exam pattern of eamcet</u></dt>
        <dd>AP EAMCET exam pattern 2023 reflects the important highlights of AP EAMCET 2023 exam, the marking scheme, weightage, and more. AP EAMCET 2023 exam pattern consists of 3 sections - Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. Candidates have to attempt 160 questions in a duration of 3 hours, i.e, 180 minutes. AP EAMCET 2023 will be conducted in a computer-based test (CBT) format.</dd>
        <dt><b>JEE MAINS</b></dt>
        <dd>Joint Entrance Examination â€“ Main (JEE-Main), formerly All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE), is an Indian standardised computer-based test for admission to various technical undergraduate programs in engineering, architecture, and planning across colleges in India. The exam is conducted by the National Testing Agency for admission to B.Tech, B.Arch, etc. programs in premier technical institutes such as the National Institutes of Technology (NIT) and Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIIT), which are based on the rank secured in the JEE-Main. It is usually conducted twice every year. Since mid of 2019, the JEE has been conducted fully online as a computerised test.</dd>
        <dt><u>Structure of the exam:</u></dt>
        <dd>The examination consists of only two papers: Paper 1 for B.E./B.Tech courses and Paper 2 for B.Arch and B.Planning courses. A candidate can opt for any or both the papers. Paper 1 is mandatorily a computer based test (called online mode) from 2018 onwards. Until 2018, there was an option between offline pen and paper mode and online computer mode. The examination was conducted only in offline pen and paper mode till 2010. In 2011, as per the orders of the Ministry of Human Resource Development, CBSE conducted Paper 1 in Computer Based Test (CBT) mode for the first one lakh candidates who opted for the same, while the remaining students took the examination in the conventional pen and paper mode. The number of attempts which a candidate can avail at the examination is limited to three in consecutive years. As of 2018, the top 2,24,000 rankers of JEE-Main will qualify to take the second and final level of examination: JEE-Advanced.

            In 2010, the Ministry of Human Resource Development announced plans to replace JEE with a common entrance test for all government engineering colleges which will be called Indian Science Engineering Eligibility Test (ISEET), by 2013. Accordingly, MHRD proposes to set up National Testing Service, which will be an autonomous and self-sustained agency to conduct this new common entrance test.
            
            The JEE-Main also serves as a preliminary requisite examination for JEE-Advanced.</dd>
        <dt><b>NEET</b></dt>
        <dd>The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate) or NEET (UG), formerly the All India Pre-Medical Test (AIPMT), is an all India pre-medical entrance test for students who wish to pursue undergraduate medical (MBBS), dental (BDS) and AYUSH (BAMS, BUMS, BHMS, etc.) courses in government and private institutions in India and also, for those intending to pursue primary medical qualification abroad.

            The exam is conducted by National Testing Agency (NTA), which provides the results to the Directorate General of Health Services under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and State Counselling Authorities for seat allocation.
            
            NEET-UG replaced the All India Pre Medical Test (AIPMT) and many other pre-medical exams conducted by states and various medical colleges. However, due to lawsuits being filed against the exam, it could not be held in 2014 and 2015.
            
            NEET-UG is a single entrance test for admissions to MBBS and BDS colleges across India. NEET UG is one of the largest exam in India in terms of registered applicants.
            
            After the enactment of NMC Act 2019 in September 2019, NEET-UG became the sole entrance test for admissions to medical colleges in India including the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research (JIPMER) which until then conducted separate exams.</dd>
        <dt><u>Structure of the exam:</u></dt>
        <dd>There are a total of 180 questions asked in the exam, 45 questions each from Physics, Chemistry, Botany and Zoology. Each correct response fetches 4 marks and each incorrect response gets -1 negative marking. The exam duration is 3 hours 20 minutes (200 min). The exam is of 720 marks (maximum marks).

            Since 2021, there has been a significant alteration in the format of the question paper. The latest structure includes two sections, i.e. A and B, in all four subjects, namely Physics, Chemistry, Botany, and Zoology. Section A comprises 35 mandatory questions, while Section B contains 15 questions, out of which 10 questions are to be answered, leading to a total of 200 questions, with 180 questions that can be answered.</dd>
