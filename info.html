    <h2><u>IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION</u></h2>
    <P>Education is not how well you can read and write but whether you can communicate with and understand the world around you. A good education not only teaches you skills but also helps you broaden your horizons, gain better perspective, and teaches you to think for yourself. People today are quite aware and comfortable speaking about social injustices and other pressing issues. This can be attributed to the increased access to education around the world, which in turn has made society more accepting and open-minded. Therefore, education is an element of human evolution. The importance of education is also pronounced in areas of creativity and innovation. Education encourages thinking outside the box and experimenting with new ideas.</P><br><br>

    <img src="images/careermp.png" id="img2">
    <p id="p2">Today’s students have a dizzying array of career avenues not available to earlier generations. On the one hand, it is exciting to have so many possibilities. But it can also feel stressful and overwhelming, especially with people unrelentingly asking, “What are you planning on doing with your life?” If you have no sense of purpose or direction, you could waste precious time in low-paying, dead-end jobs. Choosing a career path early can give you a jump-start on a bright future.
